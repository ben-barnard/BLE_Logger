# BLE_Logger
An Offline BLE Beacon Proximity Logger

Project developed to detect and log whether a wearable BLE beacon comes within range, for the purposes of research. 

Yes - I know - it would be much easier to use WiFi/LoRa/ESP-NOW and MQTT, but this application is intended for situations where you have mains power but no wireless options.
